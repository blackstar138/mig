MIG is up and running with one local agent.

This configuration is insecure, do not use it in production yet.
To make it secure, do the following:

  1. Create a PKI, give a server cert to Rabbitmq, and client certs
     to the scheduler and the agents. See doc at
     http://mig.mozilla.org/doc/configuration.rst.html#rabbitmq-tls-configuration

  2. Create *real* investigators and with 2-step authentication of actions, implies investigators need weighting when done.

  3. Enable HTTPS and active authentication in the API. Do not open the API
     to the world in the current state!

  4. You may want to add TLS to Postgres and tell the scheduler and API to use it.

  5. Change database password of users 'migapi' and 'migscheduler'. Change rabbitmq
     passwords of users 'scheduler' and 'agent';

Ensure that the RabbitMQ server is setup completely and remote agents are correctly configured.

Now to get started, launch /usr/local/bin/mig-console or /usr/local/bin/mig
